<big>Before launch</big><br>
ProgressAI is working on a new system that would <b>use AI to create comments</b> on report cards in order to <b>decrease the workload for K-12 teachers</b>.   
<br><br>
<big>The Team</big><br>
I received an email in late March that said I would be paired up with teammates named Karen and Christian. We had an initial Zoom call to introduce ourselves and <b>brainstorm</b> what our assignment could possibly be.<br>
In order to learn more about <b>articial intelligence,</b> I took a certificate program through IBM.<br>
<br>

<big>Kickoff</big><br>
We met with our Project Manager and he lined out our business goals. Using this information, <b>I created a user flow</b> for us to get started with and Karen created a project plan outlining the specific tasks. I opted to take on the research roles as my teammates created initial wireframes.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<big>First Interviews</big>
<div class="row">  
    <div class="column">
I created my initial test script, which aimed to learn about the grading process, pain points they faced with their current grading system, and what improvements they would like to see.<br>
<b>One interview was conducted over Zoom, one was conducted over the phone, and the other three were sent out as surveys</b>, as these teachers opted to go through the script themselves.
</div>

<div class="column">
<strong>✓</strong> 3/5 participants use <b>Aries</b>, and these participants like the software overall.<br>
<strong>✓</strong> 4/5 participants said grading is <b>not their favorite part of the job</b><br>
<strong>✓</strong> 2 participants input grades <b>daily</b>, 1 inputs grades <b>weekly</b>, and another inputs grades at the very <b>end of the semester</b><br>
<strong>✓</strong> 3/5 participants find the process of <b>adding comments more challenging due to the limitations on the report card.</b><br><br>
</div>


<big>Wireframes</big><br>
Using the research I conducted in the initial interviews, my teammates created a set of wireframes.<br><br>

<center><iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FEBnIUTpkLtNDJPrzeDraPD%2FProgressAI-Wireframes-(Copy)%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D1-84%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26page-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>


<br><br>
<big>Final Interviews</big>
<div class="row">  
    <div class="column">
    Using the wireframes, I created another <b>test script with tasks</b> give to our next batch of participants.
        <br><br>
        We did not have a prototype, so the participants would tell me <b>how they think they would complete the given task.</b>     
</div>

<div class="column">
<strong>✓</strong> 100% of the participants found some of the <b>headings a little confusing</b> (both in their wording and placement.<br>
<strong>✓</strong> 100% of the participants were <b>able to accurately complete the given tasks.</b><br>
<strong>✓</strong> 80% of the participants remarked that they <b>would like to be able to sign in through their Google accounts.</b><br>
<strong>✓</strong> 60% of the participants would like to see <b>improvements, such as a comment “bank,” a save button after each section, and more customization features.</b><br><br>
</div>


<br>
<br>
<big>Final Product</big><br>
I started off by changing some of the headlines the participants found confusing and I used the <b>ProgressAI style guide to add some brand colors.</b><br>
I created a <b>comment “bank” of most used comment’s in the output page</b>, based on the feedback I received when I conducted my second round of interviews.<br><br>

<big>Takeaways</big><br>
<strong>1.)</strong> <b>The importance of time management</b><br>
In the beginning, my group and I did not hit the ground running. We still finished our project on time, but it was a rush to the finish line.<br>
<strong>2.)</strong> <b>Communication is the secret weapon when working with a group</b><br>
There were definitely times when we didn’t always see eye to eye, but luckily we were able to work through it as a team.<br>
<strong>3.)</strong> <b>Don’t be afraid to ask for clarity</b><br>
There were times of uncertainty, and it was very helpful to check in with our Project Manager and make sure we are meeting company goals.
