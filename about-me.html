                <h1>Hi, I'm Haley</h1>
                <p>When I was in middle school, I spent my freetime designing and developing profiles on Myspace for people who roleplayed online (Twilight and Harry Potter, if you must know). This really kickstarted an obsession with designing and building the best profiles for my new friends online. Unknown to me, I was developing my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and learning foundational principles in user-experience design, such as the rules of visual hierarchy, for example.
                <br><br> 
                After I decided that these computer skills I picked up definitely were not going to get me a job, I had a string of jobs from food service, guest services at a hotel, and then found myself working at two different residential care homes for people with mental illness. All of these jobs provided me with the skills of communication, problem solving, and empathy.
                <br><br>
                I graduated from UCSB in 2019, where I earned my Bachelor’s degrees in Psychology and Political Science, with an emphasis in international relations. I began the Springboard UX/UI Design intensive program in July of 2022 as I honed my development skills. I love creating beautiful, accessible, and fun designs. 
                <br><br>
                When I am not staring at a computer screen, you can find me lifting at the gym, hanging out with my many houseplants, creative writing, curled up with a book, or listening to a true crime podcast. Let’s chat!
