        <big>The Background</big>
        <p>This project is the modified Google Venture Design Sprint and is provided on Bitesize UX. The project is meant to be completed in 5 days
        </p>
        <br>
        <big>The Problem</big>
        <p>These home chefs loved cooking, but were often faced with challenges like: not knowing how much time a dish would actually take, not knowing where they are in the cooking process, and what tools they needed.       </p>
        <br>

        <big>Research</big>
        <p>When brainstorming different ideas for my capstone, I chose a project that centers on two things I care about most: mental health and exercise. The two go hand-in-hand, and I wanted to develop this into an app.
        </p>
        <br>
        <big>User Interview Highlights</big>
        <p>The interviews were conducted before starting the project.<br><br>
        Here are some key quotes from my interviews:<br><br>
         <center><h3>
        “There are some things I don’t enjoy, like emptying my cabinets because I don’t know what kitchenware I need”
            <br><br>
        “I can see what the finished product looks like, but I don’t know if I am on the right track halfway through”
            <br><br>
        “... I like to be as prepared as I can before I start cooking things I can’t undo”
            <br><br>
        “I try to be as efficient as I can with how many pots and pans I use”
            <br><br>
        “I see a lot of techniques that I am totally unclear on …”

         </h3></center>   
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <big>Our Persona</big> 
        <p>I created a persona based on the information given in the user interview video. 
        <br>

<big>Day 1: Map</big>
<p>On day one, I reviewed the goals and pain points highlighted in the user interviews, and focused on possible solutions to the problems these users were facing.
</p>
<br>

<br><br>
<big>Day 2: Sketch</big>
<p>I learned about three services that provide information similar to what I am trying to build.</p>
<br><br>

<big>Crazy 8's</big><br>
<p>For 8 minutes, I generated as many sketches as possible to solve the issues our users were facing when using the Savr app. The screen I chose is one I believe will solve the pains of our users.
</p>

<br><br>
<big>Day 3: Decide</big><br>
I decided to go with a simple screen, somewhat like that of AllRecipes, but with an emphasis on tools, required ingredients, and skill level, much like how Bon Appetit incorporates those necessities into their own website.

<big>Day 4: Prototype</big><br>
On this day, I created high fidelity screens that I believed would help solve the frustrations of our users. I created many options for users to pick from, and recommended certain recipes for users. I created a simple web page where a user is able to input their experience level, the kitchenware and ingredients they possess, and their time constraints. They are met with step-by-step instructions, a progress bar, and a helpful video as they move along.
<br>

<big>Day 5: Testing</big><br>
On the last day of the spring, I conducted five usability tests with my housemates. Two cook approximately once a week, two cook about three times a week, and one cooks five or more times a week.
<br><br>
<h2>Insights</h2>
<b>></b> All users liked the simple design<br>
<b>></b> All users believed the design could have more options for cooking techniques<br>
<b>></b> All users liked the step-by-step instructions<br>
<b>></b> Two users would like to see the serving sizes<br>
<b>></b> Four users say they like the preparation and cook time separate from each other<br>
<b>></b> Three users like the option to save a recipe<br><br>


<big>Final Design</big><br>
In tidying up my UI, I made things a little more complicated (in a good way!). I created a category option bar on the side as opposed to above. I darkened the colors and created more substance, and it is more appealing to the eye than my original design. My final hi-fidelity design is shown below.

<big>Takeaways</big><br>
<b>Take your time</b><br>
Even though the sprint lasts five days, it is important to not rush through the steps
<br>
<b>It's harder than it looks</b><br>
I underestimated how difficult this assignment would be and I should have been more prepared.
<br>
<b>Have fun</b><br>
Even though there is less time to complete the project, I didn’t need to take it so seriously and just tried to focus on developing something useful but also appealing to look at
