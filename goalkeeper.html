        <big>The Background</big>
        <p>There are countless scheduling apps, but there are no apps that provide <b>motivation and progress trackers for smaller goals</b>, like making sure you’re getting enough exercise or drinking enough water. This is for people who have incredibly busy schedules, or for the person who may experience mental health issues and needs help performing more basic tasks. How might we improve the lives of our user’s by motivating them through self care and exercise?</p>
        <br>
        <big>Potential Solutions</big>
        <p>I approached this problem with the idea of creating a mobile app for users to <b>keep track of their short term and long term goals</b>, and provide users support a place of support within a community of others on similar wellness tracks. I called the app Goalkeeper.        </p>
        <br>
        <big>Potential Users</big>
        <p>My original target group focused on office workers who might need reminders to develop healthier habits in the office, like stretching and taking walks. It developed into an app for anyone who might want to better themselves, like those with busy schedules or those struggling with their mental health and requiring more support.
        </p>

        <big>My Design Process</big>
        <center><img src="https://imgur.com/cfpnsZy.png" alt="Design Process"></center>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>When brainstorming different ideas for my capstone, I chose a project that centers on two things I care about most: mental health and exercise. The two go hand-in-hand, and I wanted to develop this into an app.
        </p>
        <br>
        <big>Screener Survey</big>
        <p>I sent out fifteen surveys to friends and coworkers, who were asked questions about their workplace set up (remote, in-office, hybrid), their income, gender, and how often they practiced self care and exercise.
        </p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="https://imgur.com/nlMMN8L.png" alt="Screener Survey"></center> <BR>
        <big>First User Interviews</big> 
        <p>For my research, I interviewed five participants. Two interviews were conducted over Zoom and three were in person. 
        <br>
        Here are some key quotes from my interviews:
        </p>   
        <center><h3>“... I don’t know where to start”<br>

“... I would, if I had some sort of coach…”<br>

“If I was by myself, I wouldn’t…”</h3></center><br>

<p><u>Findings:</u><br>
Three out of five participants understood the importance of exercise and believed regular exercise would be beneficial, but did not exercise regularly because <b>they did not know where to start.</b><br>
Four out of five participants stated they <b>would exercise more if they had someone to work out with</b> or if they had some sort of authority figure (such as a coach) to tell them what to do.<br>
Two participants reported that <b>exercise and more self care activities would have helped during a time of depression</b>, but they lacked the motivation to do so.<br>
Without any sort of prompting, all participants stressed they would perform daily physical exercise or self care if it meant <b>satisfying a basic need</b>, such as getting food.</p><br>
<br>
<big>Affinity Map</big>
<p>Using the information I received in the user interviews, I created an affinity map to visualize and categorize everything I learned.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/Z6vdSkJ.png" alt="Affinity Map"></center>
<br><br>
<big>Empathy Maps</big>
<p>From there, I created two empathy maps to help myself better understand the minds of my users, and learn their pain points and desires.
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="https://imgur.com/0GYhnSo.png" alt="Ashley empathy map"><br>
<img src="https://imgur.com/L9fIuSs.png" alt="Michael empathy map"><br>
</center>
<big>Personas</big><br>
<p>Using my empathy maps, I created two personas:

Ashley is a busy woman with a lot on her plate, and desires more organization and balance in her life.
<br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/t6zHgRE.png" alt="Ashley persona"></center><br>
<p>Michael is a man struggling with his mental health, and requires a little extra help to complete more basic tasks.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/5HXZFHE.png" alt="Michael persona"></center><br><br>
<big>How Might We…?</big><br>
<p>Using everything I learned about my target users, I came up with a few HMW questions to help focus me on my journey</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/YrUzZHw.png" alt="HMW"></center><br><br>
<h2>Ideation</h2><br>
<p>When brainstorming different ideas for my capstone, I chose a project that centers on two things I care about most: mental health and exercise. The two go hand-in-hand, and I wanted to develop this into an app.</p><br>
<big>User Stories and MVP</big><br>
<p>Using my personas and empathy maps, I created user stories that Goalkeeper would deliver in the app.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/aKQsR74.png" alt="User Stories"></center><br><br>
<big>Sitemaps</big><br>
<p>I created a sitemap to display the connections of my red routes.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/MoAdl1e.png" alt="Sitemap"></center><br><br>
<big>User Flows</big><br>
<p>I then created two flows in detail, to showcase the user’s journey through the <b>Progress</b> and <b>My Goals</b> tabs.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/QpveDPH.png" alt="User Flows"></center><br>
<h2>Design and Prototype</h2>
<big>Sketches</big><br>
<p>I created simple sketches, the first vision of my design. I was able to test these out with friends and housemates before I created low-fidelity wireframes.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/iqjmwqL.png" alt="sketches"></center><br>
<big>Guerilla Usability Testing</big><br>
I spoke with five participants to provide feedback on my ideas on the original design. One of them suggested a calendar feature, which made it into my final design.<br>
<big>Moodboard</big><br>
<p>I created a moodboard to help me understand the feelings I want to evoke for my users and provide inspiration for myself. I chose images that were calming and a little magical.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/rdm7PJo.png" alt="Moodboard"></center><br>
<big>Style Guide</big><br>
<p>When coming up with a style guide, I wanted to convey something both energizing, but also a color that would evoke feelings of trust and companionship.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/nO2HAs5.png" alt="Style Guide"></center><br>
<big>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</big><br>
<p>I created some wireframes utilizing the information from my user flows, sitemaps, and usability testing.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/DXvlNEI.png" alt="Lo Fi Wireframes"></center><br>
<big>Usability Testing Part I</big><br>
<p>I recruited five participants for the first round of usability testing. I met up with the first group over Zoom.<br><br>
<u>Main Issue</u><br>
<b>#1</b> Serious UI issue - The design was jumbled and “clunky”<br>
<b>#2</b> The function to edit and add goals was not clear<br>
</p><br>
<br>

<big>Hi Fidelity Design</big><br>
<p>I added more elements to each red route and created something a little less complicated than my previous design, but added far more features.<br><br>
<i>My goals coming into this project were…</i><br>
<b>></b> Create a space for users to create and share their short term and long term goals<br>
<b>></b> Provide users with the ability to create more organization and balance in their lives
</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/HT0ZNXC.png" alt="Hi Fi Design"></center><br><br>
<big>Usability Testing Part II</big><br>
<p>Five new friends did me the great honor of participating in the second part of my usability testing. In this final round of testing, <b>participants were able to complete the necessary tasks</b>.</p><br>


<big>Iterations</big><br><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/jaKvf69.png" alt="goals"></center><br><br>
<p><b>></b> I created a format for users to track their long term goals, but also a calendar for users to be notified of scheduled events.<br>
<b>></b> I decided on a more appealing visual color palette.<br>
<b>></b> The button to edit or add a goal is more visible and easier to find.</p><br><br><br><br>

<center><img src="https://imgur.com/72tA1in.png" alt="profile"></center><br><br>
<p><b>></b> I created more of a social media aspect, where users can share their achievements and support each other. I looked back on my first interviews and wanted to create a space for the participants who wanted community in their journeys.<br>
<b>></b> The awards are displayed in a different way on the main profile, and are given for specific achievements.<br>
<b>></b> If the user wants to post an update, they would create an "Affirmation" to go with the mental wellness theme of the entire app.</p><br><br><br><br>

<br>
<big>Takeaways</big><br>
<p><b>1.) Trying to create a solution for everything isn’t possible.</b><br>
I really desired to create a great mental health app, but struggled a lot with having a focus. I tried to create a solution for every problem, but it complicated my design in the end.<br>
<b>2.) I need to have a clearer idea of the problem I am trying to solve before I try to brainstorm a solution.</b><br>
Without a clear idea of what to solve, I wasted more time trying to create a solution.<br>
<b>3.) Don’t try to rush through the steps.</b><br>
When I tried to rush through the project, I faced burnout that set me back. In the future, I need to stay on a consistent and easy pace.
