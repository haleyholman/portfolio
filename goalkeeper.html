<big>The Problem</big><br>
There are countless scheduling apps, but there are no apps that provide <b>motivation and progress trackers for smaller goals</b>, like making sure you’re getting enough exercise or drinking enough water. This is for people who have incredibly busy schedules, or for the person who may experience mental health issues and needs help performing more basic tasks. How might we improve the lives of our user’s by motivating them through self care and exercise?        <br>  
<br><br>
<big>Potential Solutions</big><br>
I approached this problem with the idea of creating a mobile app for users to <b>keep track of their short term and long term goals</b>, and provide users support a place of support within a community of others on similar wellness tracks. I called the app Goalkeeper.              

<br><br>

<h2><mark>Research</mark></h2><b></b>
When brainstorming different ideas for my capstone, I chose a project that centers on two things I care about most: mental health and exercise. The two go hand-in-hand, and I wanted to develop this into an app.

        <div class="column">For my research, I <b>interviewed</b> five participants. Two interviews were conducted over Zoom and three were in person. I then created an <mark>Affinity Map</mark> using my findings.
        <br><br>
            
        "I <b>wouldn’t get up and do those exercises if I was by myself</b>. I like being told how to do it."<br><br>
        "For self care, I would consider any kind of activity in taking care of yourself, even though it sounds really repetitive. Anything promoting your health. When I think of that, I think of <b>taking care of your emotional health, physical health, mental health</b>."<br><br>
        "Definitely some form of <b>accountability</b>. Definitely to have some kind of <b>coach to meet with who can help me</b> go over those things that are scary for me."<br><br>
        "It wasn’t super long, but it was 5 minutes to walk down to the Taco Bell, 5 minutes to wait, 5 minutes to walk back. It was just <b>nice to not be in the office</b> and it was not to be able to stretch my legs."<br>

    <h3>Ashley: The Overachiever</h3>

    Ashley has a lot on her plate and becomes easily overwhelmed by her tasks. She never takes much time for herself.
        <br>
    She wants to be able to manage stress, especially during the work day. She will sometimes realize that she hasn’t eaten or had water all day.
        <br>
    She fears of having burnout. While she loves her job, it can be tough work. She doesn’t know where to start with creating balance in her life.

<big>How Might We…?</big><br>
Using everything I learned about my target users, I came up with a few HMW questions to help focus me on my journey<br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/YrUzZHw.png" alt="HMW"></center><br><br>

<h2>Ideation</h2><br>
When brainstorming different ideas for my capstone, I chose a project that centers on two things I care about most: mental health and exercise. The two go hand-in-hand, and I wanted to develop this into an app.</p><br>

<big>User Stories and MVP</big><br>
Using my personas and empathy maps, I created user stories that Goalkeeper would deliver in the app.<br>
<center><iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVPVC5Pvg=/?moveToViewport=-2412,-774,4668,2449&embedId=252675051099" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br>

<big>Sitemaps</big><br>
I created a sitemap to display the connections of my red routes.<br>
<center><iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVPUe_MOg=/?moveToViewport=-412,-71,968,508&embedId=775187576445" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br>

<big>User Flows</big><br>
I then created two flows in detail, to showcase the user’s journey through the <b>Progress</b> and <b>My Goals</b> tabs.<br>
<center>
    <iframe width="700" height="500" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVPUfH4_A=/?moveToViewport=-1483,-898,3129,3903&embedId=407643298659" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center><br>


<h2>Design and Prototype</h2>

<big>Sketches</big><br>
I created simple sketches, the first vision of my design. I was able to test these out with friends and housemates before I created low-fidelity wireframes.</p><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/iqjmwqL.png" alt="sketches"></center><br>

<big>Guerilla Usability Testing</big><br>
I spoke with five participants to provide feedback on my ideas on the original design. One of them suggested a calendar feature, which made it into my final design.<br><br>

<big>Moodboard</big><br>
I created a moodboard to help me understand the feelings I want to evoke for my users and provide inspiration for myself. I chose images that were calming and a little magical.<br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/rdm7PJo.png" alt="Moodboard"></center><br>

<big>Style Guide</big><br>
When coming up with a style guide, I wanted to convey something both energizing, but also a color that would evoke feelings of trust and companionship.<br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/nO2HAs5.png" alt="Style Guide"></center><br>

<big>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</big><br>
I created some wireframes utilizing the information from my user flows, sitemaps, and usability testing.<br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/DXvlNEI.png" alt="Lo Fi Wireframes"></center><br>

<big>Usability Testing Part I</big><br>
I recruited five participants for the first round of usability testing. I met up with the first group over Zoom.<br><br>
<u>Main Issue</u><br>
<b>#1</b> Serious UI issue - The design was jumbled and “clunky”<br>
<b>#2</b> The function to edit and add goals was not clear<br>
<br>
<br>

<big>Hi Fidelity Design</big><br>
I added more elements to each red route and created something a little less complicated than my previous design, but added far more features.<br><br>
<i>My goals coming into this project were…</i><br>
<b>></b> Create a space for users to create and share their short term and long term goals<br>
<b>></b> Provide users with the ability to create more organization and balance in their lives
<br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/HT0ZNXC.png" alt="Hi Fi Design"></center><br><br>

<big>Usability Testing Part II</big><br>
Five new friends did me the great honor of participating in the second part of my usability testing. In this final round of testing, <b>participants were able to complete the necessary tasks</b>.<br>
<br><br>

<big>Iterations</big><br><br>
<center><img src="https://imgur.com/jaKvf69.png" alt="goals"></center><br><br>
<b>></b> I created a format for users to track their long term goals, but also a calendar for users to be notified of scheduled events.<br>
<b>></b> I decided on a more appealing visual color palette.<br>
<b>></b> The button to edit or add a goal is more visible and easier to find.<br><br><br><br>

<center><img src="https://imgur.com/72tA1in.png" alt="profile"></center><br><br>
<b>></b> I created more of a social media aspect, where users can share their achievements and support each other. I looked back on my first interviews and wanted to create a space for the participants who wanted community in their journeys.<br>
<b>></b> The awards are displayed in a different way on the main profile, and are given for specific achievements.<br>
<b>></b> If the user wants to post an update, they would create an "Affirmation" to go with the mental wellness theme of the entire app.<br><br><br><br>

<br>
<big>Takeaways</big><br>
<b>1.) Trying to create a solution for everything isn’t possible.</b><br>
I really desired to create a great mental health app, but struggled a lot with having a focus. I tried to create a solution for every problem, but it complicated my design in the end.<br>
<b>2.) I need to have a clearer idea of the problem I am trying to solve before I try to brainstorm a solution.</b><br>
Without a clear idea of what to solve, I wasted more time trying to create a solution.<br>
<b>3.) Don’t try to rush through the steps.</b><br>
When I tried to rush through the project, I faced burnout that set me back. In the future, I need to stay on a consistent and easy pace.
